Unit Testing and Mocking for API Endpoints

Objective: 
The objective of this assignment is to practice writing unit tests for API endpoints in the factory management system using the unittest module in Python. Additionally, students will learn how to use mocking to simulate external dependencies and isolate the tests from the rest of the application.

Problem Statement: 
You are tasked with writing unit tests for the API endpoints in the factory management system to ensure that each endpoint behaves as expected and handles various scenarios correctly. Additionally, you need to use mocking to simulate external dependencies, such as database interactions or external API calls, to isolate the tests and ensure that they run independently.

Task 1: Setup Testing Environment
    - Create a separate folder named tests to store all the test files.
    - Install the necessary testing libraries, including unittest and requests, using the following command:
        pip install unittest requests

Task 2: Write Unit Tests for Each Endpoint
    - Create a test class for each endpoint in the factory management system, such as TestEmployeeEndpoints, TestProductEndpoints, TestOrderEndpoints, TestCustomerEndpoints, and TestProductionEndpoints.
    - Write three individual test methods within each test class to test different scenarios for the corresponding endpoint.
    - Use the unittest.TestCase class and its assertion methods to verify the expected behavior of each endpoint.
    - Ensure that each test method is isolated and independent of other test methods to prevent interference.

Task 3: Implement Mocking for External Dependencies
    - Use the unittest.mock module to mock external dependencies, such as database interactions or external API calls, within the test cases.
    - Mock the database queries or API responses to simulate two scenarios and edge cases that may occur during testing.
    - Verify that the endpoint behaves correctly under different mocked conditions and handles exceptions gracefully.

Task 4: Run and Validate Unit Tests
    - Run all the unit tests using the following command:
    - Validate the test results to ensure that all tests pass successfully without any failures or errors.
    - If any test fails, debug the issue by reviewing the test code, endpoint implementation, and mock configurations to identify and fix the problem.


Expected Outcomes:
    - Upon completing this assignment, students should achieve the following outcomes:
        - Creation of a comprehensive set of unit tests for each API endpoint in the factory management system.
        - Utilization of the unittest module to organize and run the unit tests effectively.
        - Implementation of mocking to simulate external dependencies and isolate the tests from the rest of the application.
        - Successful execution of unit tests with passing results, demonstrating the correctness and reliability of the API endpoints under different scenarios and conditions.
